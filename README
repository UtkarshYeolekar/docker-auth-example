# Authenticating to the docker hub using (username and password)

This project is just an example on, how we can authenticate with the docker hub using username and password.
And then using the authentication token, how we can query the docker hub for getting  the private repository tags info.

Generally, for accessing the public repository info, we dont need authentication. But for getting the private 
repo info, we required authentication. 

## Prerequisites 

Afer cloning repository, do update your credentials of docker hub account and the private repository
info into the config.js

## Usage

1. npm install
2. Do update your docker hub account info (username and password) and the private repository name in the
   config file.
3. node .
