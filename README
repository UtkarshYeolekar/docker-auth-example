# Authenticating to the docker hub using (username and password)

This project is just the example on how we can authenticate with the docker hub using username and password
and using the authentication token, we can query the docker hub for getting  the private repositoriey tags info.

Generally, for accessing the public repository info, we dont need authentication. But for getting the private 
repo info, we required authentication. 

## Prerequisites 

Afer cloning repository, do update your credentials of docker hub account and the private repository
info into the config.js

## Usage

1. npm install
2. node .
